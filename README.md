### Project Description
An AI-powered hairstyle analysis web app that judges your hair choices harder than your mother and suggests "better" styles using Google's Gemini AI. Because apparently, everyone needs an AI to tell them their hair looks terrible and what they should do about it!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever looked in the mirror and thought, "I wish an AI could roast my hairstyle and give me unsolicited advice"? Well, we've got you covered! The world desperately needed another way for technology to judge our appearance and tell us how to "improve" ourselves.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a sassy AI hair critic that analyzes your photo, identifies your current hairstyle, and suggests three "better" alternatives. It's like having a brutally honest hairstylist friend, except it's a robot that never gets tired of judging you! Take a selfie, get roasted, and receive AI-generated hair wisdom you definitely didn't ask for.
